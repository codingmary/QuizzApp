### Task Description:

You are to create a simplified version of a quiz game.

1. **Game Setup:** The game should allow the player to start a new game. Before the game starts, players should be able to select a category (e.g., History, Science, Gaming) and the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
2. **Question Display:** Once the game starts, questions should be displayed one at a time with multiple-choice answers.
3. **Game Logic:** The player should select an answer for each question and get feedback if it's correct or not. The game should also keep track of the score.
